# SAFE: Slow As F\*\*k Editor

A really stupid text editor with a shell like environment to edit files just as if you're in a real shell. which in turn makes text editing really slow

# requirements:
## Pygments:
`pip install pygments`

## readline:
### windows:
___
`pip install pyreadline`
### linux (and maybe macos):
___
`pip install readline`

# config:
the configuration file for safe can be found at ~/.config/safe.ini

## SHELL:
### Bool: NerdFontIcons:
enables nerd fonts
### Bool: CtrlCQuit:
kinda broken, Use Control+C to quit 
### Bool: CoolPrompt:
uses nerd font icons to create a cool prompt (requires ColorPrompt setting to be true)
### Bool: ColorPrompt:
uses ansi escape codes to put colors in your prompt

## ALIAS:
### String: *any:
sets an alias for a command with the format: alias_name = underlying_command
