# SAFE: Slow As F\*\*k Editor

A really stupid text editor with a shell like environment to edit files just as if you're in a real shell. which in turn makes text editing really slow or really fast depending on what you use it for, but will be slow to use most of the time

### added syntax highlighting!!! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
---
syntax highlighting was surprisingly easy to add thanks to Pygments!

# requirements:
## Pygments:
`pip install pygments`

## readline:
### windows:
___
`pip install pyreadline`
### linux (and maybe macos):
___
`pip install readline`

# config:
the configuration file for safe can be found at ~/.config/safe.ini

## SHELL:
### Bool: NerdFontIcons:
enables a different promp along with nerd fonts :)
### Bool: CtrlCQuit:
kinda broken, Use Control+C to quit 

## ALIAS:
### String: *any:
sets an alias for a command with the format: alias_name = underlying_command
