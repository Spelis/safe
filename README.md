# SAFE: Slow As F\*\*k Editor

A really stupid text editor with a shell like environment to edit files just as if you're in a real shell. which in turn makes text editing really slow

# running:
* run `python -m venv .venv` to create a virtual environment
* run `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
* run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages
* run `python main.py` to start the editor
