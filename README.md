# SAFE: Slow As F\*\*k Editor

A really stupid text editor with a shell like environment to edit files just as if you're in a real shell. which in turn makes text editing really slow

# running:
* run `python -m venv .venv` to create a virtual environment
* run `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
* run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages
* run `python main.py` to start the editor

# config:
the configuration file for safe can be found at ~/.config/safe.ini

## SHELL:
### Bool: NerdFontIcons:
enables nerd fonts
### Bool: CtrlCQuit:
kinda broken, Use Control+C to quit 
### Bool: CoolPrompt:
uses nerd font icons to create a cool prompt (requires ColorPrompt setting to be true)
### Bool: ColorPrompt:
uses ansi escape codes to put colors in your prompt

## ALIAS:
### String: *any:
sets an alias for a command with the format: alias_name = underlying_command
