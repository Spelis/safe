# SAFE: Slow As F\*\*k Editor

A really stupid text editor with a shell like environment to edit files just as if you're in a real shell. which in turn makes text editing really slow or really fast depending on what you use it for, but will be slow to use most of the time

as of right now it doesnt have syntax highlighting and most likely never will as its meant to be stupid
